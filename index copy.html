    <p><h1>Previous Roles:</h1></p>
    <p>
    <strong>Ninja/Barista & Field Espresso-Tech for about 15 years (2003-2017)</strong>. After a long career in coffee I maintain my love for fine teas. Also - give me your busted up Cimballi M32 Dosatron... I can repair it and get your shop cranking again!
    </p> 
    <br/>
    <p>
      <strong>Automotive Sales/Leasing Consultant 3.5 years (2018-2021)</strong>. Without formal higher education I have relied on working in the top global industries to pay the bills. From coffee I went into cars. As a sales consultant I provided solutions-based sales techniques. I built a client base that helped me to hone my soft skills: strong organizational workflow, setting and achieving sales goals, cross-department collaboration, and active listening to name a few. My innate detail-oriented growth mindset helped me quickly establish a solid rapport with new clients and to exceed their expectations of buying a new or used vehicle! In commissioned sales it works like this: if you want a raise - sell more. Such a self-reliant role taught me I can get out of my comfort zone and create highly valuable win-win situations for the company, myself, and of course clients!
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      <strong>Head of Registration & Captain of The Goon Squad: AwesomeCon - District of Columbia (2014-2018)</strong>. My cousin is the sole founder of AwesomeCon DC. Prior to joining with Left Field Media (2016) the show was largely family operated. As head of registration my responsibilities included setting up and training staff on registration equipment. I addressed concerns on both sides of the counter. Behind the scenes I helped pay out talent from various popular shows/movies! Each iteration of the show we refined operations to the point that I was tasked with leading a crew of seasoned volunteers and staff alike. By then our attendance was over 40,000. As the Goon Squad we essentially filled in gaps and freed up bottlenecks that occurred with the massively popular panels and activities. Also memorable: we assisted the in-house venue security if a family/group somehow separated.

  <h1>Hobbies</h1>
  <p>My 9 y.o and I enjoy learning and playing all kinds of board, card, and video games!<br/> We love cooking and baking together. During the summer we like to hang out at the community pool. </p> 
  <p>I love to go mountain hiking under the light of a clear, super-moon (pictured above w/ infrared for selfie). Reaching a summit under the shade of night is a tremendously rewarding adventure and an amazing way to connect with the natural world!</p>
